**A new way to interact with your computer: bind macros to your gestures üöÄ**

GestureMacro is an application that allows you to bind custom macros to specific gestures. With this application, you can revolutionize the way you interact with your computer. Whether you're a gamer, developer, or simply someone who wants to boost their productivity, GestureMacro has got you covered!

**Project Purpose and Background**
-----------------------------

GestureMacro was created to tackle the problem of tedious keyboard shortcuts. Most applications and operating systems require you to memorize complex keyboard shortcuts to perform simple tasks. This can be frustrating and inefficient. GestureMacro solves this problem by allowing you to bind custom macros to specific gestures, making it easier and more intuitive to interact with your computer.

**Features and Functionality**
---------------------------

* Bind custom macros to specific gestures (e.g., mouse clicks, keyboard combinations, gamepad inputs)
* Create custom gesture profiles for different applications or scenarios
* Advanced gesture recognition algorithm for accurate and precise gesture detection
* Support for multiple input devices (e.g., mouse, keyboard, gamepad)

**Technology Stack**
-------------------

* **Languages:** Python
* **No frameworks or libraries used**, keeping the code lightweight and easy to maintain

**Installation and Setup**
-------------------------
